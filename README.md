# 💟 Description

🚀 Welcome to the Detra NFT Marketplace and Detra Protocol, an innovative universe where creativity merges with technology to create unique digital art pieces - NFTs. Detra isn't merely another NFT platform, it's a revolution in the NFT and copyright world.

💎 The first thing that sets us apart is our unique ability to encrypt the content of the NFTs. This means your NFT remains hidden to everyone except you, the creator, and those who have acquired the NFT. This opens up new possibilities for authors, app developers, and many others, ensuring the uniqueness and protection of their work.

💰 Secondly, it's our ability to ensure the reliability and availability of your NFTs. We utilize the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and BitTorrent File System (BTFS) for data storage, guaranteeing permanent access to your creations.

👥 The third feature is our unique ability to create exclusive communities around each NFT. In Detra, creators can form 'VIP lounges' or exclusive subscriptions for their fans, granting access only to their NFT holders.

📣 Fourthly, it's the automatic promotion of creators. Unlike other platforms like Patreon, Boosty, and their crypto counterparts, Detra provides passive promotion for creators through our intelligent algorithms that suggest items to users based on their interests.

✅ The fifth feature is the engagement of NFT owners in the creative process. At Detra, creators can conduct votes among their NFT holders, giving them the opportunity to influence future projects.

💡 The sixth feature is innovative tools like stable diffusion and GPT, which assist creators in bringing their ideas to life.

🌐 Seventh, but not least, is the fact that we give full control over NFT collections to users, unlike other platforms where the user simply mints a token within an existing collection.

In conclusion, the Detra NFT Marketplace and Detra Protocol is a space where creativity, technology, and community blend together, creating a unique realm for creators and fans alike. We're here to support and transform the creative process, offering novel ways of interaction and championing creators in their pursuit of creativity. Join our journey and become part of this amazing digital universe!
