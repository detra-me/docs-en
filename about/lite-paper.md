### Introduction

Welcome to Detra NFT Marketplace and Detra Protocol - an innovative world where creativity and technology merge to create unique digital art pieces, known as NFTs. Detra is not just another NFT platform; it's a revolution in the world of NFT and copyright.

### Problems, Goals, and Tasks of the Project

The current NFT and copyright market are facing some significant problems:

* Universal access to NFT content: Most NFTs are open for public viewing, which jeopardizes their uniqueness and protection.
* Reliability and availability of NFTs: Users need a reliable and stable storage for their NFTs.
* Lack of truly dynamic interaction between creators and NFT owners: Creators cannot fully engage their fans in their creative process.
* Copyright issues: It's difficult to track the use and distribution of art pieces after their sale.

Our goal is to solve these problems by creating a platform that respects copyright, protects the uniqueness of artworks, and allows authors to better interact with their audience.

### Project Mechanics

Detra uses a set of unique mechanisms to make NFTs more secure, accessible, and dynamic:

1. **Encrypted NFT Content:** Detra allows authors to encrypt the content of their NFTs, meaning that their works remain hidden for everyone except the author and those who purchased the NFT.
2. **Reliable and Accessible Data Storage:** We use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and BitTorrent File System (BTFS) to store data, guaranteeing constant access to your creations.
3. **Community Creation:** Detra allows authors to create "VIP lounges" or exclusive subscriptions for their fans, accessible only to their NFT owners.
4. **Automated Promotion of Authors:** On Detra, authors receive passive promotion thanks to our intelligent algorithms, which suggest goods to users in accordance with their interests.
5. **Involvement of NFT Owners:** On Detra, authors can hold votes among their NFT owners, giving them the ability to influence future projects.

### Tokenomics

The total issuance of the $DET token is 100 million. The distribution is as follows:

* 10% for airdrops
* 10% for contests
* 20% for presale
* 10% for marketing
* The remainder for Initial Coin Offering (IDO)

### Scaling

We see the path to scaling in the form of cross-chain NFTs, starting with Polygon due to its low commissions. This will allow for seamless interaction between different blockchains, increasing opportunities for users and creators on our platform. We're also considering expanding to other networks to continue enhancing our platform and meet the needs of our users.
