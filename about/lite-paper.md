### Introduction

Detra Protocol is not just a marketplace for digital assets, but also a place for creating and exchanging digital creations that can be turned into unique, non-reproducible digital goods known as NFTs (tokens that are unique digital assets and cannot be counterfeited). We offer a platform for all types of digital goods - from books, images, game assets to music, applications, educational courses, and more.

### Goals

The primary goal of Detra Protocol is to create a platform where digital content creators can easily turn their creations into NFTs, thereby safeguarding copyright. The platform also provides creators with the opportunity to interact directly with their loyal audience, creating mini-communities for NFT holders.

### Key Features

* NFT Creation: Detra Protocol offers intuitive tools for creating NFTs from any type of digital content. Additionally, creators can earn on secondary sales of their NFTs, receiving a percentage from each deal.
* Fan Club Creation: On the Detra platform, creators can create fan clubs, access to which can be obtained only if certain NFTs are held. This ensures a closer connection between creators and their fans and allows creators to hold votes and create exclusive content for NFT holders.
* VIP Lounge: Creators can set up a VIP Lounge space for a separate subscription. Fans can buy a time-limited NFT, which serves as a key to entering the VIP Lounge, where creators can offer early access to their works, hold closed auctions, votes, and more.
* Use of the Platform Token - $DET: VIP Lounge, promotion and advertising, various competitions and lotteries on the platform will be conducted for the platform token - $DET.

### Security and Privacy

Security and privacy are some of our main priorities. Detra Protocol strives to provide a safe and transparent environment for NFT trading, while maximally protecting user data. We adhere to strict security standards and use the most reliable encryption methods.

### Development and Future Plans

We start our journey using Polygon due to its low commissions, but in the future, we plan to scale to other blockchain networks.

### Tokenomics

The total issuance of the $DET token is 100 million. The distribution is as follows:

* 10% for airdrops
* 10% for contests
* 20% for presale
* 10% for marketing
* The remainder for Initial Coin Offering (IDO)

Detra Protocol is the perfect place for any digital content creators. Join us and discover the possibilities of NFTs and blockchain technologies.
